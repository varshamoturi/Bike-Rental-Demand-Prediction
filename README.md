# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Overview
In this project, we aim to predict the demand for bike sharing using various regression models. We start by exploring and cleaning the dataset, performing feature engineering, and then fitting different regression models. We evaluate the performance of each model using the R-squared metric and select the best performing model for prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about bike sharing demand, including weather conditions, time of day, season, and other relevant features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We performed univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships with the target variable. Additionally, we checked for multicollinearity and outliers in the data.

## Data Preprocessing
We encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and split the data into training and testing sets.

## Modeling
We built and evaluated several regression models, including:
- Dummy Regressor
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree
- LGBM
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Model Evaluation
We evaluated each model's performance using the R-squared metric and compared their performance to select the best model for prediction.

## Conclusion
The advanced non-linear models, including LGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, outperformed the linear regression model in predicting bike sharing demand. These models provide better accuracy and are suitable for predicting complex relationships in the data.
